### Hi there 👋

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/W7W02QLNE)

🙋🏻‍♀️ I'm Emelia, commonly found across the internet as `@thisismissem`. I'm an experienced software engineer based in Berlin. (Pronouns: she/her)

🌱 Currently I'm contributing to [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AThisIsMissEm+sort%3Aupdated-desc), [Pixelfed](https://github.com/pixelfed/pixelfed/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AThisIsMissEm+sort%3Aupdated-desc), and working on Trust & Safety for the Fediverse.

🔭 In the past I've contributed to the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/) via employment at [Inrupt](https://inrupt.com), and been a volunteer contributor to [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna), and many other projects. I've been working with Node.js since 2009/2010, and whilst I do a lot JavaScript and TypeScript, I also work with Ruby, and can understand some Go, Java, PHP, and Rust.
