## 🙋🏻‍♀️ I'm Emelia

I'm a highly experienced Software Engineer based in Berlin.
Most commonly I'm known as `@thisismissem` across the internet.

## 🌱 Currently

I'm contributing to [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AThisIsMissEm+sort%3Aupdated-desc), [Hollo](https://github.com/fedify-dev/hollo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AThisIsMissEm+sort%3Aupdated-desc), and working on Trust & Safety for the Fediverse.

## 🔭 In the past

I've contributed to the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/) via employment at [Inrupt](https://inrupt.com), and have been a volunteer contributor to [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node), [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna), and many other projects. I've been working with Node.js since 2009/2010, and whilst I do a lot JavaScript and TypeScript, I also work with Ruby, and can understand some Go, Java, PHP, and Rust.
